## To Do üìå
This is a list of things in want to do in this project:
- [X] Use ScrollMagic to create a cool scrolling effects.
- [X] Use Typed to create typing animations.
- [ ] Create all data visualisations using D3.
- [ ] Optimize the webpage for both mobile and desktop.

## Description üìù
During this project I made a mobile first scrollytelling webpage using D3.js, ScrollMagic.js and Typed.js. The webpage focuses on telling the story of excessive police brutality in the Netherlands to the user using data provided by the police and Controle Alt Delete.

## Installing üîç
To install this application enter the following into your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/BasPieren/controle-alt-delete.git

cd controle-alt-delete
```

### Packages and technologies
This project makes use of the following packages and technologies:

* [D3](https://d3js.org/)
* [ScrollMagic](http://scrollmagic.io/)
* [Typed](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/)
* [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)

## Javascript explanation ‚öôÔ∏è
Here I will explain some of the general elements used in creation of some of the animations.

### ScrollMagic
ScrollMagic allows you to trigger animations when the user reaches a certain part of the screen. Here I use it to fade in every section when the user reaches a `.cad-fade-in` section.

We loop through all the `.cad-fade-in` classes and tell the animation tween that that the div goes from an opacity of 0 to 1 which is the default value.

Then we also use the classes as trigger elements so that the animation plays when the user reaches each section on the page.

```js
const classFadeIn = document.getElementsByClassName('cad-fade-in')

for (var i = 0; i < classFadeIn.length; i++) {
  var tween = TweenMax.from(classFadeIn[i], 0.5, {
    opacity: 0,
    ease: Linear.easeNone
  })

  var scene = new ScrollMagic.Scene({
    triggerElement: classFadeIn[i]
  })
    .setTween(tween)
    .addTo(controller)
}
```

### Typed
Typed is used to add a typing animation to a text element. Here I use it to type out the total number of people who live in the Netherlands.

First we create a new ScrollMagic scene that triggers when the user reaches the `#cad-page-2` section. Then we add an `.on` start function which starts the typing animation when we reach the start of the trigger element.

Then we declare which element we want to type and what string to use and speed to type it with.

```js
var scene = new ScrollMagic.Scene({
  triggerElement: '#cad-page-2',
  reverse: false
})
  // START USE OF SOURCE: http://lucidworks.com/darkdata/
  .on('start', function() {
    var typed = new Typed('.cad-typed', {
      strings: ['17.291.396'],
      typeSpeed: 125,
      showCursor: false
    })
  })
  // END USE OF SOURCE: http://lucidworks.com/darkdata/
  .addTo(controller)
```
